# Project budcalmyNotion.github.io

This project is a web application created using Create React App. It is designed for developing and showcasing a static website.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows breaking down the interface into components and provides efficient state management for the application.

- **React Router**: A routing library for React. It enables defining navigation within the application, managing the display of different components based on the URL, and creating web applications with multiple pages.

- **Redux**: A library for managing application state. It allows for centralized state management and provides a predictable way to update the application state through the use of a "single source of truth" concept and immutable state updates.

- **HTML**: The markup language used for structuring the content of web pages.

- **CSS**: The styling language used for visually styling web pages. CSS frameworks or preprocessors may be used in the project to simplify styling.

- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for adding dynamic behavior and interactivity to web pages.
